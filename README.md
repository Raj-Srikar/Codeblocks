# [Codeblocks](https://www.codeblocks.study/codeblock/)

An intuitive and interactive environment for learning programming that generates Python and C++ executable programs in real-time as the logic blocks are interlocked together.

As of now, only the string variables and string operations are possible in the programs, because of the implementation of C++ and it being a static programming language. Support for integer variables and operations might be added in the future updates.

\- Made possible with [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).
